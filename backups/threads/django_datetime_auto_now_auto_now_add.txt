Answering a question from a co-worker learning Django:

Often times you'll need to keep track of the last time that a model instance was updated or when it's created.Â  The Django DateTime field has arguments for just that.

[ul]
[li]auto_now_add - when an instance of this model is created, set the time to "now"[/li]
[li]auto_now - whenever this model instance change, update this field to be "now"[/li]
[/ul]
On your model add:
[code]created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
modified = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)[/code]
